# AIROC&trade;: Bluetooth&reg; LE Long Range Peripheral

The following two examples, when executed together, demonstrate the use of LE Long Range PHY with Infineon AIROC&trade; CYW20829 Bluetooth&reg; devices.

1. **LE Long Range Peripheral application (GATT Server):** This application documented and demonstrated here is an implementation of Bluetooth&reg; LE custom service with security. During initialization, the app registers with the LE stack to receive notifications, including bonding complete, connection status change, and peer write. When a device is successfully bonded, the application saves the peer's Bluetooth&reg; device address to its NVRAM. Bonded devices can also write into the client configuration descriptor of the notification characteristic. That is also saved in the device's NVRAM.  When the user pushes the button, a notification/indication is sent to the bonded and registered host.

2. **LE Long Range Central application (GATT Client):** This complementary application implements the peer role as the central GATT client. Use ModusToolbox&trade; software to create the project, or view the application README and download manually from: https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-btstack-freertos-le-lr-central

Bluetooth&reg; LE Long Range (LR) feature is designed to provide extended range and improved robustness for LE devices. LR achieves this by using a new modulation scheme called Coded PHY, which uses Forward Error Correction (FEC) to improve the signal-to-noise ratio and increase the range of LE devices.

The Coded PHY scheme has two different coding schemes: **S2** and **S8**.
- **S2** provides a higher data rate than **S8**, and designed for applications that require a moderate range and data rate.
- **S8** provides the longest range and highest robustness, but has a lower data rate than **S2**. It is designed for applications that require the longest possible range and the highest robustness, even at the cost of a lower data rate.

**Note:** Both code examples are set to **S8** by default in order to showcase the longest range achievable with the Long Range feature. By setting the value of **USE_S8_DEFAULT** to **0** in the Makefile, the default coding scheme will be switched from **S8** to **S2**.

This README covers the GATT Server application in detail.

## Using the code example

Create the project and open it using one of the following:

<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox&trade; Application**). This launches the [Project Creator](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool.

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

    When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click the link from the **Quick Panel**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the **Bluetooth LE Long Range Peripheral** example by enabling the checkbox.

4. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. The **Application(s) Root Path** defaults to the Eclipse workspace which is usually the desired location for the application. If you want to store the application in a different location, you can change the *Application(s) Root Path* value. Applications that share libraries should be in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mtb_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In command-line interface (CLI)</b></summary>

ModusToolbox&trade; software provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and the command line tool, "project-creator-cli". The CLI tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the "project-creator-cli" tool. On Windows, use the command line "modus-shell" program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; software installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; software tools. You can access it by typing `modus-shell` in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

The "project-creator-cli" tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

<br>

The following example clones the "[mtb-example-btstack-freertos-le-lr-peripheral](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-btstack-freertos-le-lr-peripheral)" application with the desired name "LeLrPeripheral" configured for the *CYW920829M2EVK-02* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id CYW920829M2EVK-02 --app-id mtb-example-btstack-freertos-le-lr-peripheral --user-app-name LeLrPeripheral --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

**Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can invoke the Library Manager GUI tool from the terminal using `make library-manager` command or use the Library Manager CLI tool "library-manager-cli" to change the BSP.

The "library-manager-cli" tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--add-bsp-name` | Name of the BSP that should be added to the application | Required
`--set-active-bsp` | Name of the BSP that should be as active BSP for the application | Required
`--add-bsp-version`| Specify the version of the BSP that should be added to the application if you do not wish to use the latest from manifest | Optional
`--add-bsp-location`| Specify the location of the BSP (local/shared) if you prefer to add the BSP in a shared path | Optional

<br />

Following example adds the CYW920829M2EVK-02 BSP to the already created application and makes it the active BSP for the app:

   ```
   library-manager-cli --project "C:/mtb_projects/LeLrPeripheral" --add-bsp-name CYW920829M2EVK-02 --add-bsp-version "latest-v1.X" --add-bsp-location "local"

   library-manager-cli --project "C:/mtb_projects/LeLrPeripheral" --set-active-bsp APP_CYW920829M2EVK-02
   ```

</details>

<details><summary><b>In third-party IDEs</b></summary>

Use one of the following options:

- **Use the standalone [Project Creator](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool:**

   1. Launch Project Creator from the Windows Start menu or from *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/project-creator.exe*.

</details>

## Operation

1. Connect the two boards to your PC using the provided USB cable through the USB connector.

2. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud. You need two windows of the terminal application to view messages from both the peripheral and the central applications.

3. Program one board with the central application and the other with the peripheral application.

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
   </details>

   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

      From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain is specified in the application's Makefile but you can override this value manually:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```

    </details>

After programming, the application starts automatically.

4. Push the user button on the peripheral to start advertising.

5. Push the user button on the central board to start the connection process.

6. After establishing a connection, the peripheral application will initiate the transmission of notifications to the client.

7. To switch between S2 and S8 coding schemes, press the user button on the peripheral board.

**Note:** Changing the S2/S8 coding scheme on the peripheral board does not automatically change the coding scheme on the central board. Therefore, to ensure that both boards are using the same coding scheme, the user must press the user button on the central board to match the coding scheme for both boards.
## Programming a CYW20829 board (when multiple boards are connected)

### Get the board's serial number

1. Connect the board to your machine.

2. Go to *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/fw-loader/bin* and open the command prompt.

3. Run the following command:

   ```
   fw-loader.exe --device-list
   ```

   ![](./images/device-list.png)

4. On the text that appears, locate the following message starting with ```Connected supported devices:```.

5. Note the 16-digit number that is listed. This is the serial number of the board.

   In this example, `0B0B03B803260400` is the serial number for the board.

### From the CLI

1. Go to your application and open the Makefile.

2. Add the following to the Makefile (in the "Advanced Configuration" section):

   ```
   CY_OPENOCD_CUSTOM_COMMAND += cmsis_dap_serial <SERIAL_NUMBER>;
   ```

   **Note:** Ensure that a semicolon is added at the end of the line as shown above.

You can program the board using the `make program` command from the ModusToolbox&trade; terminal.

### From the IDE (via launch configurations available in Quick Panel)

On Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software, you need to edit the 'Program' configurations to bind them with a specific CMSIS-DAP serial number. See the following sections of the ModusToolbox&trade; user guide:

   - 5.1.6 "Select specific CMSIS-DAP device"
   - 5.1.6.2 "Selecting by serial number"

1. Select **Run** > **Debug Configurations**, and then select **GDB OpenOCD Debugging** on the Create, manage, and run configurations window.

2. Select "Bluetooth_LE_Long_Range_Peripheral Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)".

3. On the right pane, select the **Debugger** tab.

4. In **Config options**, insert the following line after ``` -c "source [find interface/kitprog3.cfg]"```:

    ```-c "cmsis_dap_serial <serial_num_1>"```

5. Select **Apply** and **Debug** for the change to take effect.

6. Similar to Step 2, select "Bluetooth_LE_Long_Range_Central Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)".

7. On the right pane, select the **Debugger** tab.

8. In **Config options**, insert the following  line after ```-c "source [find interface/kitprog3.cfg]"```:

   ```-c "cmsis_dap_serial <serial_num_2>"```

9. Click **Apply** and **Debug** for the change to take effect.

## BTSpy

BTSpy is a trace utility that can be used in the AIROC&trade; Bluetooth&reg; platforms to view protocol and generic trace messages from the embedded device. BTSpy is available as part of the ModusToolbox&trade; installation. If not, download and install [BTSpy](https://github.com/Infineon/btsdk-utils).

Do the following to configure the use of BTSpy:

1. Add the `ENABLE_BT_SPY_LOG` macro in the Makefile or command-line `DEFINES+=ENABLE_BT_SPY_LOG`.

2. Call `cybt_debug_uart_init(&debug_uart_configuration, NULL);`

   The first argument is the `debug_uart_configurations` structure pointer, which has hardware pin configurations along with baud rate and flow control configurations. Recommended baud rate is 300,0000, although 115,200 is also supported by the BTSpy tool. The second argument is an optional callback function which can be set to NULL.

3. Ensure that retarget-io is not enabled on the same UART port as BTSpy. There is no need to initialize the retarget-io library if the application wants to send both application messages and Bluetooth&reg; protocol traces to the same port through BTSpy.

4. Use compiler directives to either initialize the retarget-io library or BTSpy logs depending on the debug macro setting. '

   For example:
     ```
     #ifdef ENABLE_BT_SPY_LOG
        {
            #define DEBUG_UART_BAUDRATE 3000000
            #define DEBUG_UART_RTS        (P5_2)
            #define DEBUG_UART_CTS        (P5_3)
            cybt_debug_uart_config_t debug_uart_config = {
                    .uart_tx_pin = CYBSP_DEBUG_UART_TX,
                    .uart_rx_pin = CYBSP_DEBUG_UART_RX,
                    .uart_cts_pin = DEBUG_UART_CTS,
                    .uart_rts_pin = DEBUG_UART_RTS,
                    .baud_rate = DEBUG_UART_BAUDRATE,
                    .flow_control = TRUE
            };
            cybt_debug_uart_init(&debug_uart_config, NULL);
        }
     #else
        cy_retarget_io_init(CYBSP_DEBUG_UART_TX, CYBSP_DEBUG_UART_RX, CY_RETARGET_IO_BAUDRATE);
     #endif
     ```

## Enable BTSpy logs

1. In the Makefile, make `ENABLE_SPY_TRACES=1`.
2. Build and program the board.
3. Open ClientControl.
4. Set the baud rate to 3000000.
5. Deselect flow control.
6. Select the port and click **Open port**.
7. Launch BTSpy.
8. Press and release the reset button on the board to get BTSpy logs.
9. You should see all the application traces and the Bluetooth&reg; HCI messages. These messages help debug the HCI commands issued to the Bluetooth&reg; controller. Application traces indicate the start/stop of advertisements, connection/disconnection, and PHY updates.

## Design and implementation

### LE-LR

LE-LR represents LE Long Range PHY. The two mentioned CEs demonstrate the use of LE-LR PHY to advertise, scan for advertisements, and connect.

The mandatory symbol rate is 1 mega symbol per second (Msym/s), where 1 symbol represents 1-bit, therefore, supporting a bit rate of 1 megabit per second (Mb/s), which is referred to as the LE 1M PHY.

The 1 Msym/s symbol rate may optionally support error correction coding, which is referred to as the LE Coded PHY. This may use either of two coding schemes: S=2, where 2 symbols represent 1-bit, therefore, supporting a bit rate of 500 kb/s, and S=8, where 8 symbols represent 1-bit, therefore, supporting a bit rate of 125 kb/s.

### Program

The LE Long Range Peripheral code example configures the device as Bluetooth&reg; LE GAP Peripheral/GATT Server, and the LE Long Range Central application configures the device as Bluetooth&reg; LE GAP Central/GATT Client.

The peripheral example implements a custom GATT profile that includes the following three services:

- Hello Sensor custom service
- Device Information service
- Battery Level service

The Hello Sensor service includes a custom characteristic - *Notify*. The Notify characteristic is used to send a notification or indication to the peer client device upon connection.

The application uses a UART resource from the hardware abstraction layer (HAL) to send debug messages on a UART terminal emulator. The UART resource initialization and retargeting of standard I/O to the UART port are done using the retarget-io library.

Upon reset, the applications start automatically and initialize the Bluetooth&reg; stack and other device peripherals. The peripheral device starts to advertise its presence to the peer central device using LE-LR PHY when a button press is detected. Similarly, central device scans for the peripheral device upon button press.

After a Bluetooth&reg; LE connection is established, the peer central device registers for notifications to be received by using the CCCD handle of the Notify characteristic. Because the CCCD handle of the Notify characteristic requires write authentication, an attempt to enable notification/indication will trigger the pairing process at the central side.

After the pairing process completes, the peer device's link keys and addresses are stored in the device's flash memory and therefore bonded.

The user button on the peripheral board is configured to trigger an interrupt on the falling edge. When this button is pressed, the device will switch the coding algorithm between S=2 and S=8 and notify using the modified coding algorithm.
